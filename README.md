# 📊 Student Performance Analysis — Project Summary

This project analyzes student performance data to identify the key factors influencing exam outcomes. Using Power BI for visualization and SQL-style analysis, the dashboard explores relationships between academic, behavioral, and socio-economic variables.

The analysis shows a very strong positive relationship between previous scores and final exam scores, making prior academic performance the most reliable predictor of exam results. Attendance also demonstrates a positive correlation with exam scores, reinforcing the importance of consistent class participation.

Lifestyle factors such as sleep hours and physical activity show more nuanced effects. While moderate sleep aligns with stable performance, extreme values do not significantly improve outcomes, suggesting diminishing returns beyond healthy ranges.

Categorical factors including motivation level, internet access, parental involvement, and school type were compared against both previous and exam scores to assess their influence. These factors impact performance indirectly, primarily by shaping learning conditions rather than acting as direct predictors.

Overall, the dashboard provides actionable insights into how academic history, attendance, and learning environments collectively influence student achievement.

🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze student performance data to understand the key academic, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence exam outcomes. The dashboard aims to support data-driven decision-making by identifying patterns that can help improve student performance and learning conditions.

🔍 Key Insights
   1. Numerical Vs Outcome Analysis ![Dashboard Overview](Images/Numerical%20Vs%20Outcome%20Analysis.png)
     The findings suggest that academic consistency (previous performance) matters more than isolated behavioral factors. While sleep, tutoring, and attendance are important, their impact varies and may plateau beyond certain levels. Effective student performance strategies should therefore balance academic discipline with supportive interventions rather than relying on a single factor.

      - Average Exams Score on Sleeping Hours - Sleep Hours display a non-linear relationship with Exam Scores. While adequate rest is important, the analysis suggests that higher sleep durations (e.g., 8–10 hours) do not necessarily translate into higher exam scores and, in some cases, are associated with slightly lower performance..![Dashboard Overview](Images/Motivation%201.png)
        
      - Average Exam Score By Tutoring Sessions - Tutoring Sessions show diminishing returns. Students attending many tutoring sessions do not always achieve higher exam scores, suggesting possible over-reliance on tutoring or reduced independent study.![Dashboard Overview](Images/Tutoring%20Seasions%203.png)
        
      -  Average Exam score on Sleep Hours - From the Dashbord its clearly seen that Students who slept more hours their average scores is less. The graph shows that the more you sleep the less scores you have but students who sleps less hours had a pretty decent scores.![Dashboard Overview](Images/Sleep%20Hours%201.png)
        
      -  Previous Scores Vs Current Exam Score - Previous Scores show a very strong positive correlation with Exam Scores, indicating that prior academic performance is the most reliable predictor of future outcomes.![Dashboard Overview](Images/Previous%20Vs%20Exams%20Score%201.png)
        
2.Categorical Factors on Exam Scores ![Dashboard Overview](Images/Categorical%20Factors%20Vs%20Exams%20Score.png)
    Categorical factors significantly influence exam performance and often amplify or limit the impact of numerical factors. Motivation, home support, access to learning resources, and teaching quality collectively shape academic outcomes and should be considered in education planning and intervention strategies.

   - Impact of Motivation on Academic Performance-Students with high motivation consistently achieve higher average exam scores compared to those with medium or low motivation, highlighting motivation as a critical non-academic performance driver. ![Dashboard Overview](Images/Motivation%202.png) 
     
   - Imapct of Parental Involvemnet on Academics Performance- Learners with active parental involvement outperform those with low or no involvement, suggesting that support at home plays a meaningful role in academic outcomes. ![Dashboard Overview](Images/Parental%20involvement%202.png) 
     
   - Impact of Internet Acess on Academics Performance - Students with reliable internet access demonstrate better academic performance, likely due to improved access to learning resources, online materials, and self-study opportunities. ![Dashboard Overview](Images/internet%20acess%201.png)
     
   - Imapct of Teacher Quality on Academic Perfromance - Higher teacher quality correlates with stronger exam performance, reinforcing the importance of instructional effectiveness and classroom engagement in student success. ![Dashboard Overview](Images/Teacher%20Quality%202.png)

3.Comparative Impact Analysis ![Dashboard Overview](Images/Comparative%20Analysis.png)

This analysis compares average previous scores and current exam scores across key categorical factors to understand how different conditions influence academic progress over time.

- Comparison on Average Current & Previous Scores on Motivation Level - Students with high motivation show the strongest improvement from previous to current scores, indicating that motivation not only affects performance but also learning progression. ![Dashboard Overview](Images/Motivation%201.png)
  
- Comparison on Average Current & Previous Scores on School Type -Differences between public and private schools reveal variations in both baseline (previous scores) and exam outcomes, suggesting that learning environments contribute to academic growth. ![Dashboard Overview](Images/School%20Type%201.png)
  
- Comparison on Average Current & Previous Scores on Teacher Quality- Higher teacher quality is associated with consistently stronger previous scores and higher current exam scores, reinforcing the role of effective teaching in sustained academic improvement. ![Dashboard Overview](Images/Teacher%20Quality%201.png)
  
- Comparison on Average Current & Previous Scores on Parental Involvement - Students with active parental involvement demonstrate clearer score improvements, highlighting the long-term academic benefits of support beyond.  ![Dashboard Overview](Images/Parental%20involvement%201.png)
