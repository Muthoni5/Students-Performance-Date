# 📊 Student Performance Analysis — Project Summary

This project analyzes student performance data to identify the key factors influencing exam outcomes. Using Power BI for visualization and SQL-style analysis, the dashboard explores relationships between academic, behavioral, and socio-economic variables.

The analysis shows a very strong positive relationship between previous scores and final exam scores, making prior academic performance the most reliable predictor of exam results. Attendance also demonstrates a positive correlation with exam scores, reinforcing the importance of consistent class participation.

Lifestyle factors such as sleep hours and physical activity show more nuanced effects. While moderate sleep aligns with stable performance, extreme values do not significantly improve outcomes, suggesting diminishing returns beyond healthy ranges.

Categorical factors including motivation level, internet access, parental involvement, and school type were compared against both previous and exam scores to assess their influence. These factors impact performance indirectly, primarily by shaping learning conditions rather than acting as direct predictors.

Overall, the dashboard provides actionable insights into how academic history, attendance, and learning environments collectively influence student achievement.

🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze student performance data to understand the key academic, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence exam outcomes. The dashboard aims to support data-driven decision-making by identifying patterns that can help improve student performance and learning conditions.
